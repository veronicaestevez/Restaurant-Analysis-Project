# Restaurant Ownership Opportunities Analysis in Mexico

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the "Python for Business Analytics (Fall 2021)" course at The City College of New York. 
The objective was to analyze restaurant reviews data to provide insights and recommendations for opening a restaurant in Mexico. 
The project involved data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using SQL, Python, and Tableau/PowerBI/Excel.

**I'm recreating this project in May 2024 to showcase my skills in data analysis using SQL, Python and PowerBI.**
